However, dropout rates in schools remain a persistent challenge, often influenced by various social, economic, and demographic factors. In an effort to address this issue, the Government of Gujarat has recognized the need for a comprehensive analysis of dropout patterns at the school level. By understanding the underlying causes and identifying vulnerable groups, the government aims to formulate targeted interventions that can significantly reduce dropout rates.\n\nThis notebook presents an in-depth analysis of student dropout trends in school education, utilizing a dataset titled \"Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success - Investigating the Impact of Social and Economic Factors.\" **The dataset, sourced from Kaggle and contributed by thedevastator**(https://www.kaggle.com/thedevastator), encompasses a wide range of attributes that shed light on the dynamics contributing to student dropout.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Project Overview:**\n                  The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of student dropout rates in school education, with a focus on the state of Gujarat, utilizing the available dataset titled \"Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success - Investigating the Impact of Social and Economic Factors.\" While the dataset may not include information on schools, areas, or castes, we can still extract valuable insights from the existing attributes.\n\nThe analysis aims to provide insights into the following key aspects:\n\n**Demographic Analysis:** We will explore how demographic factors such as gender, age at enrollment, marital status, and nationality correlate with student dropout rates.\n\n**Economic Factors:** Investigate the influence of economic factors, such as parental occupation, tuition fee payment status, and scholarship eligibility, on student dropout rates.\n\n**Academic Performance:** Analyze how students' academic performance, represented by variables like curricular units and evaluations, impacts their likelihood of dropping out.\n\n**Social and Special Needs:** Explore whether students with educational special needs or those facing unique challenges like displacement or debt are more susceptible to dropout.\n\n**Macro-economic Factors:** Investigate how broader economic indicators like unemployment rate, inflation rate, and GDP growth relate to dropout rates, as these can indirectly affect education outcomes.\n\nThe expected outcome of this analysis is to provide valuable insights into the complex web of factors influencing student dropout. By identifying high-risk groups and understanding the nuanced factors contributing to dropout rates, the government can develop targeted interventions and policies to improve student retention and foster a conducive learning environment.\n\nIn the subsequent sections of this notebook, we will delve into data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the development of predictive models to aid in the dropout analysis. While we may not have school-wise, area-wise, or caste-wise information, we will use the available attributes to contribute to the government's efforts in ensuring every child's right to education and reducing dropout rates where possible.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**About DataSet:**\nThis dataset provides a comprehensive view of students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees offered at a higher education institution. It includes demographic data, social-economic factors and academic performance information that can be used to analyze the possible predictors of student dropout and academic success. This dataset contains multiple disjoint databases consisting of relevant information available at the time of enrollment, such as application mode, marital status, course chosen and more. Additionally, this data can be used to estimate overall student performance at the end of each semester by assessing curricular units credited/enrolled/evaluated/approved as well as their respective grades. Finally, we have unemployment rate, inflation rate and GDP from the region which can help us further understand how economic factors play into student dropout rates or academic success outcomes. This powerful analysis tool will provide valuable insight into what motivates students to stay in school or abandon their studies for a wide range of disciplines such as agronomy, design, education nursing journalism management social service or technologies","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Columns:**\n\n| **Column Name**                     | **Description**                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Marital status                  | The marital status of the student.
